# Role to manage users for Adoptium Build Farm
# Role can be called with an argument - to override the default userlist
# by default, vars are included from role/vars/main.yml and
# role/default/main.yml
# by default, ssh keys are generated during creation, which also creates ~/.ssh
# these new keys can be overwritten by other keys, if so desired/needed.
#
# No tags here: the role is tagged in main.yml
# sub-tasks must be tagged there as 'include_tasks' do not
# execute the included_tasks - only lists them.
---
# note: the append: element is needed to get the user: mod to report 'ok'
# versus 'changed'
