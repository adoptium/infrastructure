    # Roles are put into 6 groups
    ## AIX BOS install requirements
    ## AIX BOS configuration
    ## Core OSS (bash, unzip, gtar)
    ## AIX User Admin
    ## Additional Software
    ## OJDK Bootstraps

    # 1. AIX BOS install requirements

    # These packages are installed using installp - which can enlarge
    # filesystem space, as needed, on demand
    - openssl
    - security

    # 2. AIX BOS configuration

    - syslogs
    - crontab
    # TBD: additional tasks below that need to be promoted to
    # or migrated into an AIX setup role - in paritcular -
    # the tasks that setup the legal shells needed for user configuration
    # may need to be performed AFTER yum processing - rather than before

    # 3. Additional Software: both licensed and OSS

    # Note: although X11 is AIX BOS software - there is a chance that the
    # Ansible module unarchive: may be called - and that requires,
    # at a minimum, gtar and unzip to be available - regardless of need.
    # Likewise, the xlc files may also need the Ansible unarchive and
    # need to be evaluated after the CORE OSS software has been installed.
    - X11
    ## verify/install licensed IBM compilers
    - xlc_v13
    - xlc_v16

    # 4. Core OSS installation

    ## Note: this may actually already be performed - partially
    ## depending on how python - to use Ansible - has been prepared
    # yum based installation of additional software
    # installs some gnu packages required by ansible modules
    # Note: AIX File system configuration must be run now as RPM based software
    # cannot expand filesystem space on demand
    - aixfs
    - yum

    ## additional OSS packages
    - ant
    - ant_contrib

    # 5. AIX User Admin

    # users needed - wait until here to be sure bash is installed
    # tbd: Need other actions performed first - mainly adding /usr/bin/bash
    # to the list of legal shells.
