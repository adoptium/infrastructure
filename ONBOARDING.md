# AdoptOpenJDK - Infrastructure Onboarding Guide

## Tasks before onboarding

- Submit a Pull Request to the [README](README.md) with the proposed user and level of access required.

Assuming the PR is approved

- Create Pull Request to add user to [Infrastructure](https://github.com/adoptium/infrastructure/blob/master/README.md#infrastructure).
- Ideally request users public GPG key as well as their public SSH key.

## GitHub

Add the user to the correct Infrastructure team:

- [@admin_infrastructure](https://github.com/orgs/AdoptOpenJDK/teams/admin_infrastructure) - Super Users
- [@infrastructure](https://github.com/orgs/AdoptOpenJDK/teams/infrastructure) - Core Infra Team
- [@adoptopenjdk-infrastructure](https://github.com/orgs/AdoptOpenJDK/teams/adoptopenjdk-infrastructure) - Can be assigned Infra Issues
- [@jenkins-admins](https://github.com/orgs/AdoptOpenJDK/teams/jenkins-admins) - Super users on Jenkins

### [Secrets](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/secrets)

For [@admin_infrastructure](https://github.com/orgs/AdoptOpenJDK/teams/admin_infrastructure) and
[@infrastructure](https://github.com/orgs/AdoptOpenJDK/teams/infrastructure) teams only.

- Show user how to access the secrets repo and also how to use dotGPG to read files.
- Adding a new user to dotGPG can be done following the instructions [here](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/secrets#adding-users.)

## External Services
